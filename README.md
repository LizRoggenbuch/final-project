# final-project
In our project, we will research how hurricane frequency has increased over time and the intensity of different hurricanes across decades. We will utilize datasets comparing all major U.S. hurricanes, from 1851 - 2018.
To do this, we will graph hurricane frequencies over time using histograms, bar graphs, and scatterplots. Then, we will plot this against hurricanes that have hit Florida, possibly utilizing Basemap.
We will then compare this to migration patterns in recent years, by analyzing immigration and emigration for each Floridian county, coinciding with the hurricane years cataloged.
This will help us analyze how climate change impacts social mobility. Because of increasing temperatures and varying storm intensity, destruction to low-income communities due to storms has increased. Our project will measure the impact that hurricanes have had on movement from these communities after their destruction and entrapment of citizens.
