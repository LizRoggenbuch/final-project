# final-project
In our project, we will research how hurricane frequency has affected Floridian migration patterns.
To do this, we will graph hurricane frequencies over time. Then, we will plot this against hurricanes that have hit Florida.
We will then compare this to migration patterns in recent years. 
This will help us analyze how climate change impacts social mobility.
